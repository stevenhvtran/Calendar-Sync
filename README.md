# Calendar Sync  
A python script that takes the timetable.xlsx file produced by Allocate+ and adds each class to Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.  
NOTE:  
1.  The timetable file must be renamed and updated from a .xls to a .xlsx file first  
2.  Steps 1-2 must be completed from https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python before executing the .py file  
3.  The format_group function must be modified to have the corresponding ID's of your calendars or renamed to primary for general use
